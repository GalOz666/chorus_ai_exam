1. test that trying to access meeting leads to login page and that login works  (https://www.chorus.ai/login led me to
a 404 page [old view?], so I am using the link you sent)

2. test that you can click on play and pause - and that video is playing (current time is moving forward).

3. check that the buttons to more 15 seconds back and forth work (I was able to manually "break" the player
as you can watch here: https://drive.google.com/file/d/1RC_bjflB7wQfgiJZoAh9McTL7DdfrSVL/view?usp=sharing)

4. check that you can view transcript (and that it has more than a few entries)

5. check that the sharing splash opens and closes

6. check that you can open comments splash and that your new comment registers with the correct comment and timecode

7. check that number of comments is correct before and after adding comment
